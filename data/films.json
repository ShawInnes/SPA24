Buñuel’s first film offers a surrealistic exploration of the subconscious inviting viewers to interpret its dreamlike narrative and delve into the depths of the human psyche.  \r\n\r\nLacking a traditional structure Buñuel and Dalí craft a dreamlike and often nonsensical narrative through disjointed scenes and often bizarre and shocking imagery. The work challenges viewers to interpret meaning whilst offering a glimpse into the highly influential avant-garde art movement of the early 20th Century and is a seminal piece of surrealist cinema. \r\n\r\nL'AGE D'OR \r\n\r\nUniting the genius of Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí, L’AGE D'OR offers a uniquely savage blend of visual poetry and social commentary in a masterpiece of cinematic surrealism that remains as brilliantly witty and shocking as ever. A sinister yet poignant chronicle of a couple’s struggle to consummate their desire – the film was banned and vilified for many years for its subversive eroticism and furious dissection of ‘civilised’ values. \r\n\r\nDirected Luis Buñuel and co-written with Salvador Dalí, it challenges conventional storytelling and explores the depths of the subconscious. Celebrated for innovative cinematography, surreal imagery, and profound exploration of human desires and repression, it serves as a testament to the artistic vision of Buñuel and Dalí, who sought to create thought-provoking cinema that transcends traditional narrative structures.

Young jeweler Eugenio meets Conchita on a bus, and it is love at first sight. He learns to play guitar to accompany her in her musical career, and despite stage fright, they start to play together as ‘Els dos’. When Conchita leaves Barcelona for two weeks, she convinces Eugenio to perform solo and he becomes a phenomenon in the city’s underground stand-up comedy scene. With her help, he creates his alter ego—the dark glasses, the black shirt, the barstool, the cigarettes and the highball glass—the character that would soon become an unexpected success in a depressed nation desperate to laugh.
